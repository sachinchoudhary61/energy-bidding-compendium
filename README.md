# Energy Bidding Strategies Review

This repository contains the full research paper and supporting materials for the study titled:

**"A Comprehensive Review of Energy Trading Bidding Strategies: Traditional, Machine Learning, and AI-Driven Approaches"**

## Overview

This work provides an extensive review of bidding strategies in energy trading across three main paradigms:

- **Traditional Approaches**: Cost-based, price-based, and game-theoretic models (Nash equilibrium, supply function equilibrium).
- **Machine Learning (ML) Techniques**: Forecasting using regression, support vector machines, neural networks, and heuristic optimization like genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization.
- **AI-Driven Methods**: Reinforcement learning, deep Q-networks, multi-agent systems, and hybrid intelligent frameworks.

The paper compares these strategies based on:

- Profitability
- Complexity
- Data requirements
- Prediction accuracy

Real-world case studies from **PJM (US)**, **Nord Pool (Europe)**, and **IEX (India)** are presented to showcase strategy implementation in live markets.

## Highlights

-  Comparative table of traditional, ML, and AI strategies
-  Insights into hybrid intelligent bidding systems
-  Over 70 scholarly references reviewed
-  Applicable to researchers, power system engineers, and market analysts
